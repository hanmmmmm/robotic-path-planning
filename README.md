# Robotic path planning
This is a collection of robotic 2D path planning algorithms written by myself.

## Content:

Searching Based:
- [x] Dijkstra
- [x] A*
- [x] D*
- [ ] LPA*
- [ ] D*-lite
- [ ] Hybrid A*

Sampling Based:
- [x] RRT
- [x] RRT*
- [ ] RRT*-reeds-shepp


## Packages:
* numpy  (for array operation)
* math   (to use sin/cos)
* cv2    (for loading map images and visulization)
* random (optional, generating random numbers)
* bresenham (for getting the grids covered by a line)
* time   (optional, for timing only)
